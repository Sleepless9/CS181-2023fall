\begin{abstract}
  Car racing games have a very important practical significance and 
  pose a series of challenging technical problems. This final project 
  tries to build a model based on reinforcement learning techniques, 
  Double Q-learning (DDQN) and the OpenAI Gym environment.  We model a 
  reward system and experiment with image processing and model achitectures. 
  After 1,400 iterations, this agent can achieve the same level of performance as humans.

\section{Introduction}

Car racing games can be set up as a real-world simulation, you can define different 
constraints and goals to be achieved. Generally, OpenAI Gym's CarRacing problem needs 
the car to traverse all track tiles to finish the game, instead of running a full lap. 
While, in this project, we set the end flag to have no points for a while (in frames), 
but only points deducted, for this end condition is intended to encourage the agent to 
keep moving forward on the road, and end quickly when yawing, which maybe useful in the 
field of autonomous driving.

% \subsection{Environment}

% OpenAI Gym is a standard API for reinforcement learning, and a diverse 
% collection of reference environments. The Gym interface is simple, 
% pythonic, and capable of representing general RL problems. For Car 
% Racing(\url{https://www.gymlibrary.dev/environments/box2d/car_racing/}), 
% it is part of the Box2D environment and the basic control task is to learn from 
% pixels----a top-down racing environment. The car we would control is a powerful 
% real-wheel drive car.


% Papers to be submitted to NeurIPS 2023 must be prepared according to the
% instructions presented here. Papers may only be up to {\bf nine} pages long,
% including figures. Additional pages \emph{containing only acknowledgments and
% references} are allowed. Papers that exceed the page limit will not be
% reviewed, or in any other way considered for presentation at the conference.


% The margins in 2023 are the same as those in previous years.


% Authors are required to use the NeurIPS \LaTeX{} style files obtainable at the
% NeurIPS website as indicated below. Please make sure you use the current files
% and not previous versions. Tweaking the style files may be grounds for
% rejection.


% \subsection{Built model}



% The style files for NeurIPS and other conference information are available on
% the website at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://www.neurips.cc/}
% \end{center}
% The file \verb+neurips_2023.pdf+ contains these instructions and illustrates the
% various formatting requirements your NeurIPS paper must satisfy.


% The only supported style file for NeurIPS 2023 is \verb+neurips_2023.sty+,
% rewritten for \LaTeXe{}.  \textbf{Previous style files for \LaTeX{} 2.09,
%   Microsoft Word, and RTF are no longer supported!}


% The \LaTeX{} style file contains three optional arguments: \verb+final+, which
% creates a camera-ready copy, \verb+preprint+, which creates a preprint for
% submission to, e.g., arXiv, and \verb+nonatbib+, which will not load the
% \verb+natbib+ package for you in case of package clash.


% \paragraph{Preprint option}
% If you wish to post a preprint of your work online, e.g., on arXiv, using the
% NeurIPS style, please use the \verb+preprint+ option. This will create a
% nonanonymized version of your work with the text ``Preprint. Work in progress.''
% in the footer. This version may be distributed as you see fit, as long as you do not say which conference it was submitted to. Please \textbf{do
%   not} use the \verb+final+ option, which should \textbf{only} be used for
% papers accepted to NeurIPS. 


% At submission time, please omit the \verb+final+ and \verb+preprint+
% options. This will anonymize your submission and add line numbers to aid
% review. Please do \emph{not} refer to these line numbers in your paper as they
% will be removed during generation of camera-ready copies.


% The file \verb+neurips_2023.tex+ may be used as a ``shell'' for writing your
% paper. All you have to do is replace the author, title, abstract, and text of
% the paper with your own.


% The formatting instructions contained in these style files are summarized in
% Sections \ref{gen_inst}, \ref{headings}, and \ref{others} below.


\section{Problem Analysis}
% \label{gen_inst}
\subsection{Environment}
We choose to use OpenAI Gym's \textit{CarRacing-v0} version environment to 
train our car agent. The track is randomly generated each time the simulation begins, 
and is referred to as an "episode". Each state is a 96 $\times$ 96 RGB pixel frame which 
is the only thing that agent could observe. The frame is a top-down view of an area 
including and surrounding the car's current position. Between two frames, the car 
could make a decision to take an action or not. The action space is a combination 
of steering direction, gas and break. Each of them ranges in [-1, 1]. The whole action 
space is shown below:

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption{Action Space}
  \begin{tabular}{*{3}{>{\centering\arraybackslash}m{6em}}}
    \hline
    (-1, 1, 0.5) & (0, 1, 0.5) & (1, 1, 0.5) \\
    (-1, 1, 0) & (0, 1, 0) & (1, 1, 0) \\
    (-1, 0, 0.5) & (0, 0, 0.5) & (1, 0, 0.5) \\
    (-1, 0, 0) & (0, 0, 0) & (1, 0, 0) \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\subsection{Uncertainty}
Each state is a frame with its pixels' information.

!!!!!!!

% The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
% 9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).  Use 10~point
% type with a vertical spacing (leading) of 11~points.  Times New Roman is the
% preferred typeface throughout, and will be selected for you by default.
% Paragraphs are separated by \nicefrac{1}{2}~line space (5.5 points), with no
% indentation.


% The paper title should be 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered
% between two horizontal rules. The top rule should be 4~points thick and the
% bottom rule should be 1~point thick. Allow \nicefrac{1}{4}~inch space above and
% below the title to rules. All pages should start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the
% top of the page.


% For the final version, authors' names are set in boldface, and each name is
% centered above the corresponding address. The lead author's name is to be listed
% first (left-most), and the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to
% follow. If there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by
% side.


% Please pay special attention to the instructions in Section \ref{others}
% regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.


\section{Related Work}
\label{headings}


% All headings should be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
% flush left, and bold.


% First-level headings should be in 12-point type.


\subsection{Grayscale Convertion}
How to perform environment recognition to assist the agent in understanding the environment? 
This problem can lead to many solutions and be applied to the field of autonomous driving.

We choose to do \textbf{grayscale convertion} to help the agent learn about the environment from 
observation. Such a solution is enough to help us complete the recognition in the box2d 
environment, and will not produce too much calculation to drag down the training of the model.

% Second-level headings should be in 10-point type.


% \subsubsection{Headings: third level}


% Third-level headings should be in 10-point type.


% \paragraph{Paragraphs}


% There is also a \verb+\paragraph+ command available, which sets the heading in
% bold, flush left, and inline with the text, with the heading followed by 1\,em
% of space.

\subsection{Algorithm}




\section{Approach}
\label{others}

\subsection{Grayscale Convertion}
Get a 96 $\times$ 96 RGB three-color image from the game. Multiply the y-axis by 0.85
to remove the following scores and the status bar of the vehicle to get a complete picture, 
i.e. reduce the number of pixel blocks to be processed. 
Use cv2 to use color segmentation to convert roads into white, lawns and vehicles into black.

\subsection{Training}
We set \textbf{\textit{episode\_num}} times to loop, and run the game once in each loop. 
If the game is over or the road cannot be recognized in the image or the total 
reward is less than the minimum value or no positive reward is obtained for 100 
consecutive frames (that is, no blocks are eaten, it is purely a time deduction), 
the loop ends. Each time, the obtained state is converted from the color state 
to a grayscale image, and \textbf{\textit{road\_visibility}} is obtained from it to ensure that 
the road can be recognized in the image and avoid meaningless training sets. 
From the obtained grayscale image, the agent finds the optimal action corresponding 
to the image in the model, and uses the action to run the game to obtain the 
next state. The \textbf{\textit{skip\_frames}} method is used to introduce time continuity and 
provide the agent with more information for decision-making. 
At the same time, we process the reward obtained and set an upper limit for it. Because 
we don't want it to run too fast, so that it will be easily thrown away when turning. 
Therefore, no matter how fast the car runs, it can only get so many rewards at most, and 
going too fast will result in a low score, which will drive the car to drive rationally.
Then convert the resulting new state from the color state to a grayscale image, 
and update \textbf{\textit{road\_visibility}}.
After that, the old and new status, action, reward, and whether it is completed are stored 
in the agent, and experience playback is performed. Finally, reward is added to the total. 

The process would update the agent's action\_value network every 5 cycles.

\subsection{Test}
This part is to load the model from model to agent. Same as training part, 
We set \textbf{\textit{test\_num}} times to loop, and run the game once in each loop. 
If the game ends or the total reward is less than the minimum value or no positive 
reward is obtained for 300 consecutive frames (that is, no tiless have been traversed, it is 
purely a time deduction), the loop ends. Then convert the obtained state from 
color state to grayscale image each time. From the obtained grayscale image, 
the agent finds the optimal action corresponding to the image in the model, and uses 
the action to run the game to obtain the next state. The \textbf{\textit{skip\_frames}} method is used 
to introduce time continuity and provide the agent with more information for decision-making. 
After that, the old and new status, action, reward, and whether it is completed are stored 
in the agent, and experience playback is performed. Later, reward is added to the total. 

Finally, calculate the maximum, minimum, average, and variance of the reward obtained, and 
store the data in the ".csv" file.

% These instructions apply to everyone.


% \subsection{Citations within the text}


% The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.  Citations may be
% author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain internal consistency.  As to the
% format of the references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is
% used consistently.


% The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
% \begin{center}
%   \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
% \end{center}
% Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations appropriate for
% use in inline text.  For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
% \end{verbatim}
% produces
% \begin{quote}
%   Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
% \end{quote}


% If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may add the
% following before loading the \verb+neurips_2023+ package:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
% \end{verbatim}


% If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add the optional
% argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[nonatbib]{neurips_2023}
% \end{verbatim}


% As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the third
% person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4],'' not ``In our
% previous work [4].'' If you cite your other papers that are not widely available
% (e.g., a journal paper under review), use anonymous author names in the
% citation, e.g., an author of the form ``A.\ Anonymous'' and include a copy of the anonymized paper in the supplementary material.


% \subsection{Footnotes}


% Footnotes should be used sparingly.  If you do require a footnote, indicate
% footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote.} in the
% text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
% Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches (12~picas).


% Note that footnotes are properly typeset \emph{after} punctuation
% marks.\footnote{As in this example.}


% \subsection{Figures}


% \begin{figure}
%   \centering
%   \fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%   \caption{Sample figure caption.}
% \end{figure}


% All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark enough for
% purposes of reproduction. The figure number and caption always appear after the
% figure. Place one line space before the figure caption and one line space after
% the figure. The figure caption should be lower case (except for first word and
% proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.


% You may use color figures.  However, it is best for the figure captions and the
% paper body to be legible if the paper is printed in either black/white or in
% color.


% \subsection{Tables}


% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table number and
% title always appear before the table.  See Table~\ref{sample-table}.


% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.


% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical rules.} We
% strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package, which allows for
% typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.


% \begin{table}
%   \caption{Sample table title}
%   \label{sample-table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%     \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%     \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%     Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%     \midrule
%     Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%     Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%     Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}

% \subsection{Math}
% Note that display math in bare TeX commands will not create correct line numbers for submission. Please use LaTeX (or AMSTeX) commands for unnumbered display math. (You really shouldn't be using \$\$ anyway; see \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/503/why-is-preferable-to} and \url{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/40492/what-are-the-differences-between-align-equation-and-displaymath} for more information.)

% \subsection{Final instructions}

% Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.  In
% particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text should
% fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
% \textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
% numbered.


% \section{Preparing PDF files}


% Please prepare submission files with paper size ``US Letter,'' and not, for
% example, ``A4.''


% Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must only
% contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions to
% achieve this.


% \begin{itemize}


% \item You should directly generate PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+.


% \item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader, select the
%   menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%   also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%   available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.


% \item \verb+xfig+ "patterned" shapes are implemented with bitmap fonts.  Use
%   "solid" shapes instead.


% \item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap fonts.  You should use
%   the equivalent AMS Fonts:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage{amsfonts}
% \end{verbatim}
% followed by, e.g., \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathbb{N}+, or \verb+\mathbb{C}+
% for $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathbb{N}$ or $\mathbb{C}$.  You can also use the following
% workaround for reals, natural and complex:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%    \newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers
%    \newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
% \end{verbatim}
% Note that \verb+amsfonts+ is automatically loaded by the \verb+amssymb+ package.


% \end{itemize}


% If your file contains type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will ask
% you to fix it.


% \subsection{Margins in \LaTeX{}}


% Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
% \verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
% \verb+\includegraphics+ from the \verb+graphicx+ package. Always specify the
% figure width as a multiple of the line width as in the example below:
% \begin{verbatim}
%    \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ...
%    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf}
% \end{verbatim}
% See Section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation
% (\url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.pdf})


% A number of width problems arise when \LaTeX{} cannot properly hyphenate a
% line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command when
% necessary.


% \begin{ack}
% Use unnumbered first level headings for the acknowledgments. All acknowledgments
% go at the end of the paper before the list of references. Moreover, you are required to declare
% funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work) and competing interests (related financial activities outside the submitted work).
% More information about this disclosure can be found at: \url{https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2023/PaperInformation/FundingDisclosure}.


% Do {\bf not} include this section in the anonymized submission, only in the final paper. You can use the \texttt{ack} environment provided in the style file to autmoatically hide this section in the anonymized submission.
% \end{ack}



% \section{Supplementary Material}

% Authors may wish to optionally include extra information (complete proofs, additional experiments and plots) in the appendix. All such materials should be part of the supplemental material (submitted separately) and should NOT be included in the main submission.


\section*{References}


% References follow the acknowledgments in the camera-ready paper. Use unnumbered first-level heading for
% the references. Any choice of citation style is acceptable as long as you are
% consistent. It is permissible to reduce the font size to \verb+small+ (9 point)
% when listing the references.
% Note that the Reference section does not count towards the page limit.
